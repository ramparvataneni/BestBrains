        Now that the tag has executed, the generated content

    <!---
        Now that we have our SQL statement, let's check to see
        what type of action we are performting. UPDATE and DELETE
        will be handled custom; but, SELECT statements will just
        be passed to the normal query of query functionality.
    --->
    <cfif reFind( "(?i)^[(\s]*SELECT", sqlStatement )>
    
    
        <!---
            When SELECTing values, the user need to supply a name
            for the query. (NOTE: The UPDATE and DELETE) queries
            will grab the variable out of the SQL statement).
        --->
        <cfparam
            name="attributes.name"
            type="variablename"
            />
            
        <!---
            This is a standard SELECT statement, so just throw
            this in a CFQuery query of queries action. Store it
            directly into the caller-scoped variable provided
            by the user.
        --->
        
        <!---
            Because the reference to the original table is
            changing to the context of this tag, we need to
            append the caller scope to our internal variables
            scope.
            
            NOTE: This is a wicked LAME hack - this wasn't
            really designed to be used for SELECT statements.

                At this point, we have merged the updated columns
                back into the internal verion of our target query.
                The problem now is that we have an extra internal
                ID column. To get rid of it, and to updated the
                original query, we are going to select the records
                of the internal query into the original query
                value, selecting only the originally present

                Now that we have our SQL parsed, let's update the

                all records that do NOT match the given conditions.

                with the new result set.
                
                NOTE: This WILL break any other references to this
                query object; however, there are no defined methods
